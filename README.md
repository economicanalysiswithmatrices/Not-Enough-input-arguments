Instructions for installing and playing our game.

The objective of the game is to guess whether the next playing card is of a higher or lower value than the current card. The player is to click either ‘Higher’ or ‘Lower’ depending on what they presume the next card to be. The scoreboard accumulates $100 for each correct guess but deducts $100 for an incorrect guess, the text box below the playing card will inform the player of a win, loss or draw. The player can reset or quit the game by clicking the ‘Reset game’ or ‘Quit game’ buttons located at the bottom right of the screen. 
Good Luck!
